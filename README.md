# React Moving Average

A moving average (MA) is a widely used indicator in technical analysis that helps smooth out price action by filtering out the noise from random price fluctuations. 

It is a trend-following, or lagging, indicator because it is based on past prices.

The moving average is calculated over a period of time or certain number of past ticks/prices and is compared with the current tick/price. If the moving average is less than the current price, we want to buy and if it is greater than the current price, we want to sell.
